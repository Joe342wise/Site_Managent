# Construction Site Manager - Project Description

## Overview

The Construction Site Manager is a comprehensive desktop application designed for construction contractors to manage projects, track costs, and maintain financial control across multiple contracts. Built specifically for **De'Aion Contractors**, this application addresses the critical need for contract financial isolation and shared resource management.

## Current Implementation Status

### What's Built (Phase 1)
- **Complete CRUD Operations** for sites, estimates, and cost tracking

- **Real-time Budget Variance Analysis** with visual indicators
- **Secure Authentication** system
- **SQLite Database** for reliable data storage
- **Professional Tkinter GUI** with custom styling

### Core Business Problem Addressed
The client needed a solution to:
1. **Prevent cross-contract spending** - Stop spending Contract A money on Contract B items
2. **Optimize inventory usage** - Use owned tools/materials before purchasing new ones
3. **Track true project profitability** - Understand actual costs vs estimates per contract
4. **Maintain financial boundaries** between different construction projects
